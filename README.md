# DSTitanicProject

This is a personal data science (starter) project completed by Alex Mak. This project responds to the task of implementing a machine-learning model that can best predict the survival of Titanic passengers. Through the implementing process, this project will also serve to examine different machine-learning models as self-learning.

This project consists of the following files:

- KaggleTitanicProject.ipynb (jupyter code that can run on Kaggle)
- PythonTitanicProject.ipynb (jupyter code that can run locally with the given data files)
- submission.csv (data frame of my model's predictions towards the survival of Titanic passengers)
- test.csv & train.csv (testing and training data)
- submission.csv (supplemental data fiel for researching)
